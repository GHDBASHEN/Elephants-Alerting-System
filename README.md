### üñ•Ô∏è Example Console Output

The script displays progress logs and generates detailed alerts whenever elephants are detected in motion:

```
[INFO] Starting analysis on video_elephants.mp4
[ALERT] Elephant detected at frame 453
[ALERT] Elephant detected at frame 902
[INFO] Video processing completed.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details and Configuration

### **Motion Detection (cv2 and Background Subtraction)**
The `video_elephant_alert.py` script utilizes:
```python
cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()
```
This dynamically models the background and triggers detection only when a moving object's contour area exceeds the **`MOTION_THRESHOLD_AREA`** value.

---

### **CLIP Classification**

The system employs the **ViT-B/32** model from OpenAI‚Äôs CLIP for visual classification with optimized binary prompts.  
It ensures robust detection even in low-light or noisy conditions.

---

### **Model Portability**

The CLIP model architecture (Python-based) is initialized and its weights loaded via:

```python
torch.load("clip_detector_weights.pt", map_location=device)
```

This design separates the model definition from its parameters, ensuring easy transferability between different environments (CPU or GPU).
